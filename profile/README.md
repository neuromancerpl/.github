### Neuromancer Student Research Group - Lublin University of Technology

**The Neuromancer Student Research Group** operates within *The Faculty of Mathematics and Information Technology at Lublin University of Technology*.

Our group is dedicated to exploring the cutting-edge field of neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs). 
Our members engage in research spanning both the software and hardware aspects of these innovative technologies.
A key focus of our work involves investigating the potential of neural network accelerators, such as the Google Coral and Hailo, 
for implementing SNNs and neuromorphic computing paradigms. 
We are particularly interested in uncovering novel applications within the realm of robotics, 
pushing the boundaries of intelligent and energy-efficient robotic systems.

Through collaborative projects and independent research, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of bio-inspired computation and its practical implementation using state-of-the-art hardware. 
The Neuromancer Student Research Group provides a platform for students at Lublin University of Technology to engage with advanced concepts in artificial intelligence, 
gain hands-on experience with specialized hardware, and contribute to the growing field of neuromorphic engineering.
